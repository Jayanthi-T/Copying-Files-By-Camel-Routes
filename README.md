# Copying-Files-By-Camel-Routes

## 1. Delete data/output directory
## 2. Run CopyFilesByCamelRoute which is inside src/main/java/org.camelRoute
## 3. Now we can see fileWithMsg.txt which is inside input folder been copied inside output folder (No need to create output folder, camel will create its on its own)

## So file been copied :)
